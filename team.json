    "bio":"I started on my journey to learn about human relationships at UC Davis where I received my bachelor's degrees in psychology and sociology. I continued my education at California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University earning a master's and doctoral degree. I began my training with a focus on child and family psychotherapy through community clinics providing services to foster children and low income families. Through my training I have gained expertise in working with children and teens through individual and family therapy. Working with families has allowed me gain expertise in working with individuals of various ages with consideration of how family history and relationships impact who they are and obstacles they may face. I have successfully assisted parents in strengthening their parenting skills while helping them feel empowered. Upon licensure I began working with children ages 2-5 focused on assisting caregivers with building a strong positive relationship in order for both caregiver and child to become resilient and successful. I am currently working on certification in Parent Child Interaction Therapy through UC Davis. I also have a passion for working with children and adults with ADHD knowing that the challenges can be a lifelong struggle. I work with a strength based approach knowing that individuals have internal resources to help them overcome any difficulties they are facing. Knowing that humans and relationships are constantly evolving, I continue my journey in professional development in an effort to learn approaches that will best help individuals."

    "bio":"Introduction: Hello, my name is Dr. Edgar Petrosyan, and I am a Psychological Assistant with a Doctoral Degree in Clinical Psychology, with Emphasis in Depth Psychology, a modality primarily based on the theories of Carl G. Jung.  My approach to helping clients is based on the understanding that as we move forward in life/time, we come across challenges that sometimes make it difficult for us to move forward.  These challenges may have been experienced anytime from infancy to adulthood.  Due to the passage of time and natural defenses, we may no longer be aware of how we are still effected by the difficulties experienced in our past, which may be nothing more then a feeling, or a pattern of relationships.  These effects may be embodied as depression, anxiety, addiction, relationship difficulties, and so on.  My goal as your therapist will be to help you build a better relationship with yourself by challenging you to navigate through the difficult emotions at an appropriate pace, which will naturally lead to improved relationships and overall happiness.  I approach each of my clients as unique individuals, a uniqueness that some may say is forged by chance, such as, year of birth, culture and family in which the person is born into, childhood experiences, personality traits, unconscious drives, and so on.  Therefore, I approach each individual with the respect that all these factors, as well as those not mentioned, helped forge you into a one of a kind masterpiece in the making, a work of art for which there is no replica."
