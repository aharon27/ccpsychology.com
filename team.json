The worst thing we can do is put our happiness on lay away where we say if only this happens then I will be happy. In our work together we will work to break down the shoulds and what if’s which brings feelings of anxiety, resentment, and depression and instead dive into what how you can be more present in this moment. Don’t let another day pass where you are not getting to own and live your authentic truth. I’m honored to hopefully be part of your journey to self discovery."

I work holistically, meaning I view the mind, body, spirit connection as essential in understanding you as a whole person, while also integrating mindfulness & self compassion practices. I invite you to show up exactly as yourself. Some days there will be laughter, and other times I will support a much-needed cry. I believe in the healing power of relationships, so it's most important you feel safe, heard, & truly seen.

Jung.  My approach to helping clients is based on the understanding that as we move forward in life/time, we come across challenges that sometimes make it difficult for us to move forward.  These challenges may have been experienced anytime from infancy to adulthood.  Due to the passage of time and natural defenses, we may no longer be aware of how we are still effected by the difficulties experienced in our past, which may be nothing more then a feeling, or a pattern of relationships.  These effects may be embodied as depression, anxiety, addiction, relationship difficulties, and so on.  My goal as your therapist will be to help you build a better relationship with yourself by challenging you to navigate through the difficult emotions at an appropriate pace, which will naturally lead to improved relationships and overall happiness.  I approach each of my clients as unique individuals, a uniqueness that some may say is forged by chance, such as, year of birth, culture and family in which the person is born into, childhood experiences, personality traits, unconscious drives, and so on.  Therefore, I approach each individual with the respect that all these factors, as well as those not mentioned, helped forge you into a one of a kind masterpiece in the making, a work of art for which there is no replica."
